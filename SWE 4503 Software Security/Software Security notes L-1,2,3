Software Security


A Malware is a set of instructions that run on your computer and make your system do something that an attacker wants it to do.

 Payload
• The action that a threat performs, apart from its main behaviour.

Security is concerned with preventing undesired behavior.

Confidentiality
• Data confidentiality: Assures that confidential information is not disclosed to
unauthorized individuals
• Privacy: Assures that individual control or influence what information may be collected and stored

Integrity
• Data integrity: assures that information and programs are changed only in a
specified and authorized manner
• System integrity: Assures that a system performs its operations in unimpaired manner

Availability
assure that systems works promptly and service is not denied to authorized users

Authenticity: 
the property of being genuine and being able to be verified and trusted; confident in the validity of a transmission, or a message, or its originator

Accountability: 
generates the requirement for actions of an entity to be traced uniquely to that individual to support nonrepudiation, deference, fault isolation, etc

• Asset –
(System Resource) – anything that has value to an
individual, an organization or a government

• Access - 
a subject or object’s ability to use, manipulate,
modify, or affect another subject or object.

• Vulnerability – 
weakness of an asset or control that can be exploited by a threat
• Flaw or weakness in a system's design, implementation, or operation and management that could be exploited to violate the system's security policy.
• Categories of vulnerabilities
• Corrupted (loss of integrity)
• Leaky (loss of confidentiality)
• Unavailable or very slow (loss of availability)


• Threat – : 
potential cause of an unwanted incident, which may result in
harm to a system, individual or organization


• Attack - 
an act that is an intentional or unintentional attempt to cause damage or compromise to the information and/or the systems that support it.
• Categories of Attacks
• Passive – attempt to learn or make use of information from the system that does not
affect system resources
• Active – attempt to alter system resources or affect their operation
• Insider – initiated by an entity inside the security perimeter
• Outsider – initiated from outside the perimeter
 

•Risk - 
An expectation of loss expressed as the probability that a particular threat will exploit a particular vulnerability with a particular harmful result.
 

•Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS): 
are systems composed of physical systems (hardware), software systems and potentially other types of systems (e.g., human systems). 
These are closely integrated and networked to deliver some global behaviour.
 


Software security is a kind of computer security that focuses on the secure design and implementation of software.
• Using the best language, tools, methods


Network security:
•Protection of the underlying networking infrastructure from unauthorized access and misuse.
 

Application security
•aims to protect Software code, Software and hardware system, Data against cyber threats.
• introduce a secure software development life cycle to development teams.
 

Web Security
• Process, technology or method for protecting
• Web servers, web applications, and web services against different security threats that exploit vulnerabilities in an application’s code.
• Critical to the business continuity


Information security
• Protecting information and information systems from unauthorized use, assess, modification or removal.


Cybersecurity = security of information systems, applications and networks in the face of attacks, 
accidents and failures with the goal of protecting operations and assets
