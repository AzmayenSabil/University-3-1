An operating system is a program that manages the computer hardware. It also provides a basis for application programs and acts as an intermediary between the computer user and the computer hardware.

users -> application -> OS -> hardware
OS: ease of use, resource allocator, control program

OS also known as KERNEL 
System programs and application programs

general purpose system: 1 or more CPU, device controller, memory

bootstrap program/firmware initiates OS. stored in ROM or EEPROM

Interrupts are an important part of a computer architecture. Each computer design has its own interrupt mechanism, but several functions are common. The interrupt must transfer control to the appropriate interrupt service routine. The straightforward method for handling this transfer would be to invoke a generic routine to examine the interrupt information; the routine, in turn, would call the interrupt-specific handler.


CPU loads instructions from memory
volatile -> loses contents when power is off.

asymmetric multiprocessing 
symmetric multiprocessing 

UMA -> uniform memory access
NUMA -> non uniform memory access

user mode, kernel mode (mode bit 0,1)
